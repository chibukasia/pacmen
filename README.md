# PacMan Exercise

## Description

This project involves creating a simple PacMan animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The PacMan moves horizontally across the screen, changing direction when it reaches the edges.

## How to Run

To run this project on your machine:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to implement the following improvements:
- Add additional features to PacMan's movement, such as vertical movement or random bouncing.
- Enhance the visual appearance with more detailed PacMan images and background animations.
- Implement user controls to interact with PacMan's movement, such as starting, pausing, or resetting the animation.
